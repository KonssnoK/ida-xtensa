# ida-xtensa
This is a processor plugin for IDA 7.x, to support the Xtensa core found in
Espressif ESP8266 and ESP32.
It does not support other configurations of the Xtensa architecture, but that is probably
(hopefully) easy to implement.

This is a beta release, for your hacking pleasure.

## Usage
Copy the file to the `procs/` directory in your IDA install. Ta-daa!

## License
GPLv2!
